# Resume Screening Automation

This project focuses on automating the resume screening process before any hiring takes place. We aim to create chatbots that can interact with users after they submit their resumes. These chatbots will ask questions, and the next chatbot will provide answers based on the content of the submitted resume. Additionally, we plan to develop a GitHub bot that will assess and rate projects by carefully analyzing the code and scoring them based on various criteria.

## Motivation

Our goal is to simplify the work of HR professionals and potentially replace the often manipulative ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score system. We have considered various scenarios and are working towards building an application that offers authentic, automated, and unique resume-based screening solutions.

## Technologies Used

- **Language Model**: We have employed the Mistral 7B model from LM Studio for natural language processing tasks.

- **Frontend**: We have built the frontend using ReactJS, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive interface.

- **Backend**: For the server-side, we utilized Django, a powerful Python web framework. 

- **Programming Language**: Python was extensively used in various components of the project.

## Key Features

- **Chatbots**: We have developed chatbots that can ask relevant questions to applicants and generate responses based on their submitted resumes, improving the interaction and screening process.

- **GitHub Bot**: Our GitHub bot is designed to evaluate project repositories by carefully examining the code quality and other criteria, providing meaningful scores.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the frontend by navigating to the ReactJS project folder and running the necessary commands.
3. Configure the Django backend according to your requirements.
4. Install any required Python packages using pip.
5. Run the application and deploy it to your desired environment.
